# Greetings my code name is Zec
 - I'm 20
# Background
- I've been coding since I was in 6th grade, making Minecraft clients for over 2 years using JavaScript on this channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eue1Hhog8ZM) I've been constantly improving every day as my logic regarding coding and critical thinking has also been improving. After college, it boosted me a lot, allowing me to explore various coding topics and experiment with different technologies, especially databases. There, I learned how to clean data and create my own panel using access.
- What's most intrigue about myself is that i've been purusing reverse engineering **legally** as I could not just not earn money but also help and improve my critical thinking... also machine learning as I wanna see an a.i that improve himself everyday and giving him alot of data
